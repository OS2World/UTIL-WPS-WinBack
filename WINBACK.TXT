WinBack Utility v 2.0 - modified by Manfred Huber

Description of version 2.0
--------------------------
I wasn't able to start WinBack from an Icon on OS/2 2.1 BETA 6.479,
so I decided to port it to 32 Bit using C-Set/2. Besides this there are
no functional differences to v 1.2 This Version does not work with pre 2.0
versions of OS/2. New makefile included.

The changes in version 2.0 are minor.  Full credit belongs to Robert Mahoney.

WinBack Utility v 1.2 - modified by Rick Papo

Description of version 1.2
--------------------------
Great add-on to OS/2, but I didn't like how the window stayed active after
being pushed down to the bottom of the stack.  That, and I wanted the thing
to show in the system task list, so I could cancel it if necessary without
having to reboot.  Having something in the task list doesn't clutter the PM
screen, after all.  Both changes are incorporated in this version.

Changes have been made to winback.c, winhook.c & winback.dlg.  In addition,
it has been tested under OS/2 2.0 (beta 6.149).

WinBack Utility v 1.1 - modified by Rick Suntag

Description of version 1.1
--------------------------
When I first used the Winback utility by Robert Mahoney, I thought it
was a great idea.  Previosly, I had been ALT-Escaping and then finding
the correct window.  Sometimes, this led to a full screen group or even
the Dos group being selected...a real pain.  The original utility opened
a PM window and gave the user the ability to turn WinBack on and off.  As
I said above, this utility is a great idea and I saw no need to ever turn
it off.  Since there is no need to disable the utility, there is also no need
to clutter PM with another window.  The following changes have been made:

        1)  When the program is started, a 4 second dialog box with program
            info is displayed on the screen.
        2)  WinBack does not appear in the Task List and runs in the
            background.

Changes have been made to winback.c,winback.h,winback.rc,winback.dlg
No changes have been made in the winhook.c (DLL source) from Robert Mahoney.

DESCRIPTION
------------
   This utility will allow you to push any active window to the
bottom of the window pile.

INSTALLATION
------------
   Place WINBACK.EXE on your PATH. Place WINHOOK.DLL on your
LIBPATH.  Put an entry for WINBACK.EXE in a group and set the
open when system started option.

USAGE
-----
   Double-click with the right mouse button on the titlebar of an
active window.

DETAILS
-------
   I developed this utility after being exposed to Sun's Unix GUI,
OpenLook.  One of the neat features of this GUI (the only neat
feature IMHO) is when you click with the right mouse button
anywhere on the titlebar, you get a menu similar to PM's system
menu.  But it also includes a choice: BACK which will push the
window to the bottom of the pile.  I thought this would be very handy
for PM, especially with my small screen.
   Using a sysem input hook, it was amazingly easy to do.  Now all I
have to do is double-click with the right mouse button on the titlebar
and the window goes to the bottom of the pile.
It took me about 3 hours of coding.  Input hooks really should be
written in assembler because *all* messages pass through the hook
procedure, but as long as you only have a few input hooks, and they
don't do any kind of real processing then you shouldn't notice any
slowdowns.
